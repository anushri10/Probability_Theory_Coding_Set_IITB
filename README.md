Problem 1
Scenario 1.1: 
Simulate the roll of an unbiased six-faced die n times, using a list/arrays data structure.
  Input: Integer n, 0 < n < 100,000,000
  Expected Output: Series of die faces as n numbers
  Test Cases: n = {0, 10, 39, 500,000, 1,000,000,000}


Scenario 1.2: 
Simulate the roll of a biased six-faced die n times, such that: (Note: Assume the bias as necessary)
  (i)	The die rolls to 3 50% of the time
  (ii)	The die rolls to 6 more than 50% of the time
  (iii)	The die rolls to 1 less than 50% of the time

Input(s): Integer n, 0 < n < 100,000,000
Expected Output(s): 3 series of die faces as n numbers
Test Cases: n = {0, 10, 39, 500,000, 1,000,000,000}



Problem 2
Scenario 2.1: 
Simulate the roll of an unbiased six-faced die n times, such that:
  (i)	The die and rolls to 3 50% of the time
  (ii)	The die and rolls to 6 more than 50% of the time
  (iii)	The die rolls to 1 less than 50% of the time
  (iv)	The die rolls to a number more than 3, more than 50% of the time

For each case perform the following tasks:
  (i)	Find the probability of the top face being 5 and plot a distribution graph
  (ii)	Find the average count for each face of the die and plot a distribution graph

Input(s): Integer n, 0 < n < 100,000,000
Expected Output(s): 3 series of die faces as n numbers
Test Cases: n = {0, 10, 39, 500,000, 1,000,000,000}
